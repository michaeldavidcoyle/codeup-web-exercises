 An ice cream seller can't go home until she sells all of her cones. First write
 enough code that generates a random number between 50 and 100 representing the
 amount of cones to sell before you start your loop. Inside of the loop your
 code should generate another random number between 1 and 5, simulating the
 amount of cones being bought by her clients. Use a do-while loop to log to the
