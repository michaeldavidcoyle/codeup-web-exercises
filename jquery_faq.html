    <h1>National Parks: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>What government agency oversees the National Park Service?</dt>
        <dd>
            The National Park Service is a bureau of the Department of the Interior.
            Directly overseeing its operation is the department's Assistant Secretary
            for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
        </dd>

        <dt>How old is the National Park System?</dt>
        <dd>
            The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson
            on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established by an act signed by
            President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park.

        </dd>

        <dt>How many people visit the national parks?</dt>
        <dd>Total recreation visitors to the national parks in 2019: 327,516,619.</dd>

        <dt>What is the most-visited national park?</dt>
        <dd>View a list of the most-visited sites in the National Park Service.</dd>

        <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
        <dd>
            Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain park
            entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee
            sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See
            the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes
            available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to
            more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual,
            Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the
            America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass.
        </dd>

        <dt>Where can I find a park map?</dt>
        <dd>
            You can view maps on specific park websites or find national park, National Park System,
            National Trails System, and other maps.
        </dd>

        <dt>Can I bring my pet to a national park?</dt>
        <dd>
            Some national parks welcome pets—in developed areas, on many trails and campgrounds,
            and in some lodging facilities. Learn more about pets in parks.
        </dd>

        <dt>What is the largest national park site? Smallest?</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Largest: Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, AK, at 13.2 million acres</li>
                <li>Smallest: Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial, PA, at 0.02 acres</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?</dt>
        <dd>
            For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this
            service; many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific
            camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check
            specific park websites. You can also learn more about camping in national parks and find
            a map of parks with camping opportunities.
        </dd>

        <dt>How do I reserve a tour in a park?</dt>
        <dd>
            You can book some park tours through Recreation.gov such as Pearl Harbor National Memorial,
            many Mammoth Cave National Park cave tours, Independence National Historical Park tours, and
            more. Not all parks participate in this reservation service. For more information on tours
            offered at a specific park, please see the park search.

    <h3>Sequoia National Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sequoia was the first park created to protect a living organism. Found only in the unique
            environment of the western Sierra, the massive sequoia trees grow at between 5,000 and 8,000
            feet in elevation. The relatively mild winters at that elevation, along with a traditional
            history of fire, has made the mid-Sierra zone the perfect habitat for sequoias. To protect
            the giant sequoias from logging, Sequoia National Park was established in 1890.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sequoia is home to the tallest mountain in the lower 48. Towering 14,494 feet, Mount Whitney lies on the
            eastern border of Sequoia National Park and Inyo National Forest.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sequoias are some of the largest and oldest trees in the world. These massive trees can live for over 3,000
            years thanks to a chemical in their bark called tannin, which helps to protect against rot, boring insects
            and even fire.
        </li>
        <li>
            The most famous resident of Sequoia National Park, the General Sherman Tree, stretches almost 275 feet
            tall and over 36 feet in diameter, making it the largest tree in the world by volume.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Kings Canyon National Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Before Kings Canyon, there was General Grant National Park. A week after Sequoia was created in 1890,
            General Grant National Park was established to protect the sequoias in the General Grant Grove. In 1940,
            Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt created a new national park called Kings Canyon that
            incorporated the area of General Grant National Park with the spectacular canyons and high Sierra country to
            the east. Since Kings Canyon’s roots go back to General Grant National Park, it shares the title of our
            country’s third national park with Yosemite National Park.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most of these parks are wilderness. Over the past 125 years, Congress has expanded Sequoia and Kings Canyon
            National Parks to 1,353 square miles -- of which over 95 percent is designated and managed as wilderness.
            The parks’ wilderness protects areas from the foothills to the high country that teem with granite peaks and
            glacial canyons for visitors to explore.
        </li>
        <li>The first known inhabitants of the area now designated as Kings Canyon National Park were the Monache Indians.</li>
        <li>
            Kings Canyon National Park features Kings Canyon, a glacial valley with cliffs, meadows, waterfalls, and a
            river. The canyon deepens outside the park making it North America's deepest.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Big Bend National Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Big Bend was made a national park on June 20, 1935</li>
        <li>The name Big Bend comes from a large bend in the Rio Grande River along the park boundary.</li>
        <li>Big Bend National Park covers a total area of 801,163 acres</li>
        <li>
            In 2012, the park was named as an International Dark Sky Park. Big Bend National Park has the darkest
            measured skies in the lower 48 states, and star gazing here is obviously superb.
