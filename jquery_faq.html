    <h1>National Parks: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>What government agency oversees the National Park Service?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            The National Park Service is a bureau of the Department of the Interior.
            Directly overseeing its operation is the department's Assistant Secretary
            for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
        </dd>

        <dt>How old is the National Park System?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson
            on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established by an act signed by
            President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park.

        <dt>How many people visit the national parks?</dt>

        <dd class="invisible">View a list of the most-visited sites in the National Park Service.</dd>

        <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain park
            entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee
            sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See
            the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes
            available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to
            more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual,
            Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the
            America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass.
        </dd>

        <dt>Where can I find a park map?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            You can view maps on specific park websites or find national park, National Park System,
            National Trails System, and other maps.
        </dd>

        <dt>Can I bring my pet to a national park?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            Some national parks welcome petsâ€”in developed areas, on many trails and campgrounds,
            and in some lodging facilities. Learn more about pets in parks.
        </dd>

        <dt>What is the largest national park site? Smallest?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            <ul>
                <li>Largest: Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, AK, at 13.2 million acres</li>
                <li>Smallest: Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial, PA, at 0.02 acres</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this
            service; many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific
            camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check
            specific park websites. You can also learn more about camping in national parks and find
            a map of parks with camping opportunities.
        </dd>

        <dt>How do I reserve a tour in a park?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            You can book some park tours through Recreation.gov such as Pearl Harbor National Memorial,
            many Mammoth Cave National Park cave tours, Independence National Historical Park tours, and
            more. Not all parks participate in this reservation service. For more information on tours
            offered at a specific park, please see the park search.
